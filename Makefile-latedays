# This Makefile's skeleton comes from Prof. Tia Newhall from Swarthmore
# College. My alma mater keeps taking care of me :)

#
# 'make depend' uses makedepend to automatically generate dependencies 
#               (dependencies are added to end of Makefile)
# 'make'        build executable file 'mycc'
# 'make clean'  removes all .o and executable files
#

# define the C compiler to use
CC = g++

# define any compile-time flags
CFLAGS = --std=c++11 -g -fopenmp -Wall 

# define any directories containing header files other than /usr/include

# define library paths in addition to /usr/lib
#   if I wanted to include libraries not in /usr/lib I'd specify
#   their path using -Lpath, something like:

# define any libraries to link into executable:
#   if I want to link in libraries (libx.so or libx.a) I use the -llibname

# On Latedays can't link both gflags and glog because glog already statically
# links gflags

# From Wikipedia:
# 	"pkg-config is computer program that provides a unified interface for 
# 	 querying installed libraries for the purpose of compiling software from 
# 	 its source code. It allows programmers and installation scripts to work 
# 	 without explicit knowledge of detailed library path information."

# with the .o suffix
